# Comprehensive Plan to Reproduce the Transformer Model

## 1. Model Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
The Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of stacked layers. Each layer contains self-attention and a feed-forward network with residual connections and layer normalization.

### 1.2 Encoder
- **Layers**: 6 identical layers.
- **Each Layer**:
  - **Self-Attention**: Multi-head attention with 8 heads.
  - **Feed-Forward Network**: Two linear transformations with ReLU activation. Dimensions: d_model=512, d_ff=2048.

### 1.3 Decoder
- **Layers**: 6 identical layers.
- **Each Layer**:
  - **Self-Attention**: Multi-head attention with 8 heads, masked to prevent future token access.
  - **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Multi-head attention over encoder outputs.
  - **Feed-Forward Network**: Same as encoder.

### 1.4 Attention Mechanisms
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: 
  - Compute dot products of queries and keys, scaled by 1/sqrt(d_k).
  - Apply softmax to get attention weights, then apply to values.
- **Multi-Head Attention**:
  - Project queries, keys, and values into h=8 subspaces.
  - Compute attention for each subspace and concatenate results.

### 1.5 Positional Encoding
- **Method**: Sine and cosine functions based on position.
- **Dimensions**: d_model=512.

### 1.6 Embeddings
- **Token Embeddings**: Shared between encoder and decoder.
- **Positional Embeddings**: Added to token embeddings.

## 2. Training Setup

### 2.1 Dataset
- **English-German (WMT 2014)**: 4.5M sentence pairs, byte-pair encoded.
- **English-French (WMT 2014)**: 36M sentence pairs, word-piece encoded.

### 2.2 Training Configuration
- **Hardware**: 8 GPUs.
- **Batching**: 25000 source and target tokens per batch.
- **Dropout**: Rate P_drop=0.1.
- **Label Smoothing**: ϵ_ls=0.1.

### 2.3 Optimization
- **Optimizer**: Adam with β1=0.9, β2=0.98, ϵ=1e-9.
- **Learning Rate Schedule**: Linear warmup for 4000 steps, then inverse square root decay.

### 2.4 Training Process
- **Checkpointing**: Save models every 10 minutes for base models, every 30 minutes for big models.
- **Averaging Checkpoints**: Use last 5 (base) or 20 (big) checkpoints for final model.

## 3. Evaluation Protocol

### 3.1 Metrics
- **BLEU Score**: Primary metric for translation tasks.
- **F1 Score**: For constituency parsing.

### 3.2 Evaluation Setup
- **Beam Search**: Beam size=4, length penalty α=0.6.
- **Maximum Output Length**: Input length +50.

### 3.3 Model Variations
- **Parameter Tuning**: Test different attention heads, key/value dimensions, model sizes, and dropout rates.
- **Positional Encoding**: Compare sinusoidal with learned embeddings.

### 3.4 Additional Tasks
- **Constituency Parsing**: Use WSJ and semi-supervised datasets. Adjust model size (d_model=1024) and training parameters.

## 4. Implementation Strategy

### 4.1 Code Structure
- **Modules**: Separate into attention, feed-forward, encoder, decoder, and model classes.
- **Training Loop**: Handle distributed training across GPUs, batch processing, and checkpoint management.

### 4.2 Dataset Handling
- **Tokenization**: Implement byte-pair encoding and word-piece tokenization.
- **Data Loading**: Efficiently load and batch data, ensuring token counts are balanced.

### 4.3 Attention Implementation
- **Scaled Dot-Product**: Compute attention with proper scaling and masking.
- **Multi-Head**: Parallel computation across heads, concatenate results.

### 4.4 Positional Encoding
- **Function**: Generate positional encodings using sine and cosine functions.
- **Integration**: Add to embeddings before processing.

### 4.5 Training Details
- **Optimizer Setup**: Configure Adam with given parameters.
- **Learning Rate Schedule**: Implement warmup and decay phases.
- **Regularization**: Apply dropout and label smoothing.

### 4.6 Evaluation

- **Gradient Analysis**: Monitor for vanishing or exploding gradients.

## 6. Timeline

### 6.1 Short-Term (1-2 weeks)
- **Model Implementation**: Core components (encoder, decoder, attention).
- **Training Loop**: Set up basic training with a single GPU.

### 6.2 Medium-Term (3-4 weeks)
- **Distributed Training**: Optimize for multiple GPUs.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement BLEU and F1 scoring.

### 6.3 Long-Term (5-6 weeks)
- **Model Variations**: Test different configurations.
- **Additional Tasks**: Extend to constituency parsing.
