Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the evaluation.py file is supposed to handle two main tasks: calculating BLEU scores for translation and F1 scores for constituency parsing. It also needs to manage beam search for translation. \n\nLooking at the design document, the evaluation module should have functions for evaluation, BLEU calculation, and F1 scoring. The main.py will orchestrate these processes. \n\nI remember the paper mentioned using beam search with a beam size of 4 and a length penalty alpha of 0.6. Also, the maximum output length during inference is input length +50. These details should be included in the evaluation functions.\n\nThe configuration file specifies the beam size, alpha, and max output length, so I should reference these settings. However, the evaluation should also allow some flexibility, maybe using default values if the config isn't available.\n\nFor the BLEU score, I'll need a function that takes the model's predictions and the target texts. The function should compute the BLEU score using a library like sacrebleu. Similarly, for F1 score, I'll need to evaluate parsed trees against the gold standard, which might involve some tree matching algorithm.\n\nI should also consider how to structure the evaluation function. It should probably take the model, data loader, and configuration, then run evaluation on the entire dataset, collecting metrics like BLEU or F1.\n\nI need to make sure that the evaluation function returns a dictionary of metrics, which can then be used for reporting or comparisons. Also, handling cases where the configuration isn't provided by using default values is important for robustness.\n\nPutting it all together, the evaluation.py should have clear functions for each metric, with proper documentation and parameters. It should integrate smoothly with the rest of the code, especially the trainer and main modules.\n\nI should also think about any potential issues, like ensuring the correct tokenization during evaluation or handling cases where the model's output exceeds the max length. But for now, focusing on the core functionality as per the paper and plan is key.\n</think>\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nevaluation.py\n\"\"\"\n\nimport torch\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sacrebleu import BLEU\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\nfrom dataset_loader import DatasetLoader\n\nclass Evaluator:\n    def __init__(self, model: torch.nn.Module, eval_loader: DataLoader, config: Dict[str, Any] = None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the evaluator with the model, data loader, and configuration.\n        \n        Args:\n            model: The Transformer model to evaluate.\n            eval_loader: DataLoader for the evaluation dataset.\n            config: Configuration settings, including beam search parameters and maximum output length.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.model = model\n        self.eval_loader = eval_loader\n        self.config = config if config else {}\n        \n        #
