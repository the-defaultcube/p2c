Let me start by understanding the requirements.\n\nFirst, the dataset_loader.py is supposed to handle loading and preprocessing of WMT datasets. It should implement byte-pair encoding for English-German and word-piece encoding for English-French. It also needs to provide DataLoaders for training and evaluation.\n\nLooking at the configuration file, config.yaml, I see that the dataset is WMT2014, with language pairs English-German and English-French. The vocabulary size is 32000, and the maximum length is 100. \n\nThe task list in the design document mentions that dataset_loader.py should handle tokenization, batching, and dataset splitting. So, I need to break down each of these steps.\n\nTokenization: For English-German, byte-pair encoding (BPE) is used. For English-French, word-piece encoding is used. I remember that BPE involves splitting words into subwords based on frequency, while word-piece uses a similar approach but might be more context-aware.\n\nData Preprocessing: This includes normalizing text, handling punctuation, and ensuring that sequences are within the maximum length specified. I should also consider padding or truncating sequences to maintain uniform batch sizes.\n\nDataset Splitting: The WMT dataset typically has a training, validation, and test split. The loader should create these splits, ensuring that the data is properly divided for training and evaluation.\n\nBatching: The configuration specifies a batch size of 25000 tokens per batch. I need to make sure that each batch contains approximately this number of source and target tokens. Also, during data loading, the batches should be formed efficiently to avoid memory issues.\n\nNow, considering the design's data structures and interfaces, the DatasetLoader class needs to have methods for loading data and creating DataLoaders. It should accept the data path and batch size as parameters.\n\nI should also think about how to handle different tokenization methods for each language pair. Maybe using the tokenizers library, which supports BPE and word-piece. For BPE, I can use the SentencePiece tokenizer with the appropriate model, and similarly for word-piece.\n\nAnother consideration is the efficiency of tokenization. Since the datasets are large, the tokenization process should be optimized, perhaps using pre-trained tokenizers or caching tokenized data to speed up subsequent runs.\n\nI also need to ensure that the DataLoaders are correctly set up for both training and evaluation. For training, the DataLoader should shuffle the data, while for evaluation, it shouldn't, to maintain the order for correct metrics.\n\nLastly, I should handle any edge cases, such as empty sequences or mismatched source and target lengths, by filtering them out during preprocessing.\n\nPutting it all together, the logic analysis should outline each step clearly, ensuring that the dataset_loader.py can handle the specified tasks efficiently and correctly.\n</think>\n\n### Logic Analysis for `dataset_loader.py`\n\nThe `dataset_loader.py` module is responsible for loading and preprocessing the WMT datasets, implementing the appropriate tokenization methods for each language pair, and providing DataLoaders for both training and evaluation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the logic and steps required to achieve this:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Dataset Handling and Configuration**\n\n- **Dataset Sources**: \n  - Use the WMT 2014 English-German and English-French datasets.\n  - Ensure the datasets are downloaded and stored in the specified `data_path`.\n\n- **Dataset Configuration**:\n  - **Language Pairs**: English-German and English-French.\n  - **Vocabulary Size**: 32000 tokens.\n  - **Maximum Sequence Length**: 100 tokens.\n\n- **Data Splitting**:\n  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.\n  - Use standard splits (e.g., 90% training, 5% validation, 5% test).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Tokenization**\n\n- **English-German**:\n  - Implement byte-pair encoding (BPE).\n  - Use a pre-trained BPE model or train one on the dataset.\n  - Ensure consistent tokenization across training, validation, and test sets.\n\n- **English-French**:\n  - Implement word-piece tokenization.\n  - Use a pre-trained word-piece model or train one on the dataset.\n  - Ensure consistent tokenization across training, validation, and test sets.\n\n- **Tokenization Tools**:\n  - Use the `tokenizers` library for both BPE and word-piece tokenization.\n  - Ensure compatibility with the specified vocabulary size.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Data Preprocessing**\n\n- **Text Normalization**:\n  - Normalize text (e.g., lowercase, remove extra whitespace).\n  - Handle punctuation and special characters appropriately.\n\n- **Sequence Truncation and Padding**:\n  - Truncate sequences longer than the maximum length (100 tokens).\n  - Pad shorter sequences to the maximum length with a padding token.\n\n- **Token Alignment**:\n  - Ensure that source and target sequences are properly aligned.\n  - Handle cases where source and target sequences have different lengths by filtering or padding as needed.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Dataset Splitting and Batch Creation**\n\n- **Training, Validation, and Test Sets**:\n  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets based on the specified proportions.\n  - Ensure that the split is deterministic and reproducible.\n\n- **Batching**:\n  - Create batches of source and target sequences.\n  - Each batch should contain approximately 25,000 tokens for both source and target.\n  - Use dynamic batching if necessary to handle varying sequence lengths.\n\n- **DataLoader Configuration**:\n  - Create separate DataLoaders for training, validation, and test sets.\n  - Set the batch size, shuffle the training data, and ensure efficient iteration.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Integration with the Training and Evaluation Workflow**\n\n- **DataLoader Class**:\n  - Implement a `DatasetLoader` class that handles the loading and preprocessing of the datasets.\n  - The class should provide methods to return DataLoaders for training and evaluation.\n\n- **Shared Knowledge**:\n  - Ensure that the tokenization and encoding schemes used in `dataset_loader.py` are consistent with those used in `evaluation.py`.\n  - Use the same vocabulary and tokenization methods for both training and evaluation.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Implementation Details**\n\n- **File Structure**:\n  - The `dataset_loader.py` file should include functions or methods for:\n    - Loading raw data.\n    - Tokenizing and preprocessing the data.\n    - Creating DataLoaders for training and evaluation.\n\n- **Code Logic**:\n  - **Loading Data**: Read the raw text files for each language pair.\n  - **Tokenization**: Apply the appropriate tokenization method (BPE for English-German, word-piece for English-French).\n  - **Preprocessing**: Normalize, truncate, and pad sequences.\n  - **Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.\n  - **Batching**: Create batches of source and target sequences.\n  - **DataLoader**: Return DataLoaders for use in the training and evaluation processes.\n\n---\n\n### **7.
